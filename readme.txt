Cookie-Script.com WordPress plugin.

== Description ==
<strong>CookieScript</strong> helps your WordPress site meet privacy requirements like <strong>GDPR, CPRA, PIPEDA</strong> and more. It adds a cookie banner to your site—no need to edit files or write any code yourself.

You can use it right after installing, <strong>even without a CookieScript account</strong>. Later on, if you want to adjust how the banner looks or behaves, you can link an account to unlock more options.

The plugin works with <strong>Google Consent Mode v2</strong> and the <strong>WP Consent API</strong>, and can <strong>block third-party cookies</strong> until a visitor gives permission. It keeps your site compliant without interfering with tools like Google Analytics or ads.

<strong>Is Google Consent Mode supported?</strong>

Yes. CookieScript includes support for Google Consent Mode v2, so your site can continue collecting analytics and serving ads—while still respecting visitors’ choices. You’ll find the option in your CookieScript dashboard.

<strong>Can it work with the WP Consent API?</strong>

It can. If your site uses other plugins that rely on the WordPress Consent API, they’ll be able to read the same consent choices shared by CookieScript.

<strong>What about third-party cookies - can it block those?</strong>

Yes. Once you configure your banner in the CookieScript dashboard, it can prevent third-party scripts from running until users agree to it.

<strong>Where can I get support?</strong>
